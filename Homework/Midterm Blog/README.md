Welp I probably should have written this *while* we were working. My role was documenting everything and coordinating as well as sitting alongside Dylan and Weibo working together with each of them on the majority of the Arduino and Pi code. I was also able to spend some time retrieving a log file off the Pi using SSM. That was satisfying to do solo. Also did some coordinating for the class to have the teams speak to eachother/ set up meet hangs when needed. 

I'll revisit the code tonight and add some more thoughts shortly.
